# IntroChem-Library
## About
- A library of functions to efficiently solve introductory chemistry problems.  This library was coded from scratch using jupyter notebooks.
## Content
- The molecular weights of common elements on the periodic table are stored as variables with their chemical symbols pointing to them.  
- functions to help with unit conversion (e.g. atoms to moles)
- solvers for common equations such as the ideal gas law.  These functions will give you the value for the parameter with None passed through.
